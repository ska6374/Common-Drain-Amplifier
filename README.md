# Common Drain Amplifier
<br>
A common-drain amplifier, also known as a source follower, is a single-stage field-effect transistor (FET) amplifier topology that's often used as a voltage buffer. It's similar to the common collector configuration of a bipolar transistor.  <BR><BR>
<h2>I. A common drain amplifier has several advantages, including :</h2><BR>
1. High input impedance and low output impedance :<br>
This allows the output voltage to be sampled and fed back into the input in series with the input voltage.<br>
2. Unity voltage gain :<br>
The AC output voltage is the same as the AC input voltage.<br>
3. Low dependence on load resistor :<br>
This means it can be used to drive low resistance loads, such as a speaker.<br>
4. Useful for buffering :<br>
When placed at the output of an op amp, it can make a great voltage buffer.<br>
5. Useful for creating oscillators :<br>
The input and output impedances can be used to create oscillators or two-terminal active inductors. <br>
